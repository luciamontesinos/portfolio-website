## Process
This set of images was generated using three layers of 3D Perlin Noise. The first two dimensions were used to create the images, while the third dimension simulated flame movement by manipulating the flame's depth and intensity. Each layer of Perlin Noise added texture and shaped the flame. To recreate the colors of fire, the distance to a reference point was calculated for each point in the image, and a corresponding color was assigned.

## Context
This was a project for my bachelor's course "Advanced Programming." The assignment was to generate any type of media using procedural algorithms. I chose to recreate fire because I found the movement of flames fascinating.
