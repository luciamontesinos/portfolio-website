## Process
I am using WebMidi.js and p5.js to transform music into live visuals. Currently, I use the name, octave, attack, and duration of each note pressed to change the appearance of the shape by manipulating tone, saturation, bumps, and spherical coordinates. Additionally, the shape rotates to the BPM of the music.

## Context
I started experimenting with Processing and a MIDI keyboard. Initially, I was very engaged in this side project, but I eventually set it aside. Unlike many other projects, I decided to revive it over the Easter break. Although it still needs improvement, I wanted to share this first functional version.
