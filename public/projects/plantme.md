## Process
Using the Spotify API, the user's listening history is analyzed based on song features such as energy, mood, and other attributes. This data is combined with physical activity monitoring through the phone's accelerometer and the user's self-reflection about their mood to generate a score. This score is then transformed into a plant. In the garden view, the user can easily get an overview of how their well-being has fluctuated throughout the month.

## Context
This was a 3-person group project for the Personal Data Interaction and Wearables course. We designed and partially implemented a self-assessment app for well-being. PlantMe tracks the user's music listening behavior, physical activity, and mood input to generate a visual diary in the shape of a garden.
