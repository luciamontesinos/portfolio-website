## Process
This system combines an app that collects the user's physical activity and location data with weather and UV index information for that location. Based on WHO recommendations, the system determines whether it needs to act. Once a day, the smart lamp automatically communicates with the user to check if they have had enough exercise. Depending on the weather forecast, it recommends activities, a mood-lifting song, and, if necessary, some minutes of exposure to the SAD light.

## Context
My teammates and I designed and implemented a seasonal depression monitoring system to help users stay active and combat common depression symptoms. The system combines a mobile sensing app with a smart lamp (featuring a SAD light, a speaker, and a Raspberry Pi).
