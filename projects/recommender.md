## Process
The system uses a camera to recognize facial expressions and classifies them using a Convolutional Neural Network into categories such as sad, neutral, or happy, assigning each a score. The recommendation system is content-based, as songs are tagged by their genres.

## Context
This was my bachelor's thesis. The motivation behind this project was to explore new ways of discovering music. I designed and developed a music recommender that uses the listener's reactions to a set of songs as input to generate a recommended playlist for discovery.
