## Process
The idea revolves around a system that integrates public databases from big cities and combines them with machine learning and a map services platform to create a database of all parking spots in the city. The platform updates parking spot availability in real time using sensors incorporated into private or public services. To park, the user makes a request, and the system responds with the fastest or nearest available spot. By incorporating sensors into public services such as taxis or buses, the database is continuously updated. Private users can also contribute by using these sensors. The Arduino prototype consisted of a proximity sensor that sent a message to a server with the GPS coordinates of the free spot.

## Context
As a final project for an innovation course, my teammate and I designed and implemented a prototype in Arduino for a novel parking system. The purpose was to facilitate parking for users, save their time, and reduce pollution in big cities.
