## Process
By leveraging OpenAI's Whisper, ChatGPT, and Google's Text-to-Speech APIs, we created an AI assistant capable of engaging in conversations. The primary task of the assistant was to summarize our weekly work. To achieve this, we carefully crafted its prompt to encourage follow-up questions and clarifications. This experiment was incredibly enjoyable as it combined design, software development, and maker skills.

## Context
In the summer of 2023, I was part of Schibstedâ€™s Futures Lab in Oslo. Over two months, we developed a Conversational User Interface (CUI) and embodied it in an old Ericofon 700. As inspiration for the project, we explored representations of CUIs in science fiction.
